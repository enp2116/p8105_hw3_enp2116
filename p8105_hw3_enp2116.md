# Problem 1

Loading the instacart dataset from p8105.datasets:

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

Exploration of the dataset:

The `instacart` dataset is tidy, with 1384617 rows and 15 columns,
indicating we have data on 1384617 different products ordered through
instacart and we have information on 15 different dimensions in each of
these product orders. The `instacart` dataset contains the variables:
order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set,
order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order,
product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department.

Key variables include user_id, order_id, and aisle. User_id has values
such as 112108, 79431, 42756, 17227, 56463, 125030, with 131209 distinct
users in total. Order_id such as 1, 36, 38, 96, 98, 112, with 131209
total orders in this dataset. Finally, aisle has values such as yogurt,
other creams cheeses, fresh vegetables, fresh vegetables, canned meat
seafood, fresh fruits.

For a single order, there are multiple observations, such as all the
products for order 1:

-   How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

There are 134 aisles. Fresh vegetables and fresh fruits are ordered
most, with 150609 orders and 150473, respectively.

-   Plot showing the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting
    this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered, and ordering
    aisles by number of orders.

``` r
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(
    n_obs = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_obs > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = forcats::fct_reorder(aisle, n_obs, desc)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_obs)) + geom_point(aes(aisle, n_obs), alpha = .5) +
  labs(

    y = "Number of Orders"
    )  +  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

-   Table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
    “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
    fruits”, including the number of times each item is ordered.

``` r

-   Table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and
    Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week, formatted as a
    readable 2 x 7 table.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

# Problem 2

This problem uses five weeks of accelerometer data collected on a 63
year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac Care
Center of Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with
congestive heart failure (CHF). The data can be downloaded here. In this
spreadsheet, variables activity.\* are the activity counts for each
minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.

-   Loading, tidying, and otherwise wrangling the data; including all
    originally observed variables and values; have useful variable
    names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data with
    reasonable variable classes.

``` r
accel_data =
  read_csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    split_week = case_when(day == "Saturday" ~ 'weekend',
                          day == "Sunday" ~ 'weekend',
                          day == "Monday" ~ 'weekday',
                          day == "Tuesday" ~ 'weekday',
                          day == "Wednesday" ~ 'weekday',
                          day == "Thursday" ~ 'weekday',
                          day == "Friday" ~ 'weekday')) %>% 
relocate(split_week)
```

Describe the resulting dataset (e.g. what variables exist, how many
observations, etc).

The `accel` dataset is tidy, with 35 rows and 1444 columns, indicating
we have accelerometer data for 35 different days. In addition to
accelerometer data, the `accel` dataset contains variables: day, day_id,
week, and split_week. Day has values such as Friday, Monday, Saturday,
Sunday, Thursday, Tuesday, day_id such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, week such as
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and split_week such as weekday, weekend. For each single
day, there are 1,440 activity counts. Activity counts take on values
such as 88.3777778, 1, 47.3555556, 64.8222222, 71.0666667, 675.

-   Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total
    activity over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across
    minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create
    a table showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
accel_data %>% 
  group_by(day) %>% 
  summarize (daily_total_activity = sum(across(activity_1:activity_1440), na.rm = T)) %>%
  spread(key = day, value = daily_total_activity) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 0)
```

|  Friday |  Monday | Saturday |  Sunday | Thursday | Tuesday | Wednesday |
|--------:|--------:|---------:|--------:|---------:|--------:|----------:|
| 2291711 | 1858699 |  1369237 | 1919213 |  2091151 | 1799238 |   2129772 |

-   Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of
    the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity
    time courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week.
    Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on
    this graph.

# Problem 3

Loading the NY NOAA dataset from p8105.datasets:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

Exploration of this dataset: To that end, write a short description of
the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some
key variables, and indicating the extent to which missing data is an
issue.

Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the results of each):

-   Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month,
    and day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and
    snowfall are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the
    most commonly observed values? Why?

-   Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January
    and in July in each station across years. Is there any observable /
    interpretable structure? Any outliers?

-   Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
    (note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make
    a plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0
    and less than 100 separately by year.
